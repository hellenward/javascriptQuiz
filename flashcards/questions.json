        "It only works at an altitude of 5,000 feet or higher",
        "It is the favoured languages of important people like executives",
        "You don't need to know how it works, just that it does"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "It contains abstractions to manage hardware resources for you, you don't have to worry about it",
      "moreInfo": "There are a low level languages, such as C, which requires the user to manage hardware resources such as memory or CPU. High level languages, such as Javascript, do not require this as they contain abstractions to do that job for us. This has its advantages but the downside is that it may not be as fast or optimised as some of the lower level languages."
